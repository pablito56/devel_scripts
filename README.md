Development scripts
===================

Several useful scripts and tools to use on your development environment. Mainly implemented in Bash or Python. Most of them should work on Mac OS X or any Linux flavour, although some could be specific for Mac OS X only.

* **auto_venv**: Lightweight automatic Virtualenv activation / deactivation.
* **custom_cd**: Custom *cd* command to access your current project root folder instead of your home when doing `cd`.
